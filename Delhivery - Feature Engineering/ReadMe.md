# Delhivery Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
## Project Overview:

This project focuses on preparing and engineering features from Delhivery’s logistics data. Delhivery, India’s largest logistics provider, relies on a data-driven approach to optimize operations. This analysis cleanses, aggregates, and processes raw data to help the data science team build forecasting models, providing insights for more efficient and accurate deliveries.

## Business Problem
Delhivery’s data team needs a clean, structured dataset with engineered features to facilitate the development of forecasting models. These features are crucial to understanding trip efficiency, handling time, distance discrepancies, and route optimizations, ultimately widening Delhivery’s lead over its competitors in logistics quality, efficiency, and profitability.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises logistics records with fields indicating trip details, routes, timestamps, and transportation type. The data is a combination of training and testing sets, with records split into multiple rows for single deliveries that involve several stages. This project uses Python’s pandas library for data manipulation and scipy.stats for hypothesis testing.

## Project Steps
1. **Initial Data Exploration and Cleaning**
Load and Inspect: Import the dataset, checking for data types, missing values, and summary statistics.
Missing Value Handling: Replace missing values in categorical columns with a placeholder, and fill numerical missing values with median/mean or drop if not relevant.
Data Structure: Ensure categorical columns are properly labeled, and verify numerical data for consistency.
2. **Feature Engineering**
Aggregation: Group records based on trip_uuid, source_center, and destination_center using aggregation methods (sum, cumsum, first, last).
Derived Features:
Extract day, month, year from trip_creation_time.
Split source_name and destination_name to extract city, place, and state codes.
Calculate trip duration as the difference between od_start_time and od_end_time.
Cumulative Aggregation:
Aggregate actual_time, segment_actual_time, osrm_time, and osrm_distance by trip_uuid for a complete picture of each trip’s total distance and time.
3. **Advanced Analysis**
Hypothesis Testing:
Conduct hypothesis testing to compare actual times with OSRM times and actual distances with OSRM distances for both aggregate and segment levels.
Use visual analysis (histograms, scatter plots) to validate and interpret differences.
Analysis of Time Discrepancies:
Compare actual_time against start_scan_to_end_scan and analyze potential delays or discrepancies using visual and statistical methods.
4. **Outlier Detection and Handling**
Outlier Identification:
Detect outliers in continuous variables (e.g., actual_time, osrm_time, segment_osrm_time) using IQR-based methods.
Visualize outliers with boxplots and histograms to understand their impact on model performance.
Outlier Handling:
Treat outliers by capping/flooring based on the IQR method or removing extreme values if necessary.
5. **Encoding and Normalization**
Categorical Encoding:
Apply one-hot encoding to categorical variables (e.g., route_type) to make them model-ready.
Feature Scaling:
Normalize or standardize numerical features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler for better compatibility with algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

# Concepts Used
Feature Creation: Extract relevant features from timestamps, locations, and distances to enhance model readiness.
Relationship Analysis: Examine the relationships between time, distance, and route attributes.
Column Normalization/Standardization: Prepare numerical data for improved model stability.
Categorical Encoding: Transform categorical variables for numerical compatibility.
Outlier Treatment: Detect and address outliers for clean, robust data.
