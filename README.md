# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This folder contains a collection of data science projects showcasing various data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques. 
Each project aims to solve a unique problem, providing insights and practical applications of data science concepts.

## Overview

This repository is designed to demonstrate skills in data science, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment. 
Each project focuses on a different aspect of data science and showcases methods and tools commonly used in the field.

## Project Structure
Each project is organized in its own directory, containing:

* **README.md**:  Overview of the project, objectives, and results.
* **data**: Sample datasets (where legally shareable) or instructions for accessing data.
* **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing the project analysis and model development.
